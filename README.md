# BinaryTableGenerator-CSV
A program that generates a csv of a binary table for a given number of columns.

This program only creates tables with column lengths from 1-19 because of csv file restrictions (1,000,000 rows max) and the fact that a table with a size more than 19 would be massive in file size.
